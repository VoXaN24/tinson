# Tinson
A great JSON file manager for tinfoil. Install every NSP directly on Switch without using cables.

## Why should I use this?
Well, I don't know why you have to use it. I've developed this because my cat jump on my keyboard every time I'm using my mac. 

So, here it comes: Welcome Tinson!

## Getting started
Tinson is based on PHP and JS. So for working you must have a web server which can process PHP. 

### Prerequisites

 * A web server compatible with PHP
 * FTP or SSH
 * Nothing else

There's a lot of free hosting reseller online so this won't be hard to achieve.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository on your PC (or directly on your webserver if you have SSH access).
2. Upload this cloned folder on your website through FTP (you can use [filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or anything you want).
3. _Optional_ change the folder name for something you like.
4. You're ready to create and manage your games list.

If your website is: `example.com` open Tinson looking for `example.com/tinson-master`. If you have changed the folder name change the path based on new folder name.

### How to use

**At the moment Tinson works only for Google Drive's links.** 

What you need for uploading correctly a link is: 
* Google Drive download ID
* Target NSP name

### Authors

Thanks to the one which gave me the idea.
* My cat (get off that keyboard Minou!)
